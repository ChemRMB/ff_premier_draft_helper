- Ensure that the draft carries over to the next event
- evaluate if players from the bench should be added in 
- evaluate if we need to trade players and it it is for my opponents or the players that are not already taken
- ensure that we can pull current season and player statistics
- make a flask application for the change in rosters over the weeks and for my oponents
- the flask application should also have statistics for each game week and the different player performances
- the flask application should also have a sum of the statistics per team and per player
